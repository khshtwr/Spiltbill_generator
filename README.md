SplitBill Generator
Welcome to SplitBill Generator, a Python project designed to simplify the process of splitting bills among friends! ðŸ§¾ðŸ’°

Project Overview:
SplitBill Generator leverages Python's data types, numerical operations, type conversion, and f-strings to efficiently calculate and split bills based on user input.

Key Features:
Data Types: Utilized to store information such as bill amount, number of people, and individual shares.
Numerical Operations: Implemented to perform calculations for dividing bills evenly among participants.
Type Conversion: Ensured correct data types for inputs and outputs, converting strings to integers or floats as necessary.
F-Strings: Employed to format output messages and display results clearly and concisely.
How It Works:
Enter Bill Details: Input the total bill amount and the number of people sharing the bill.
Calculate Shares: SplitBill Generator computes the amount each person needs to pay, taking into account any remainder if the division isn't exact.
Display Results: Output the individual shares using f-strings for readability and precision.


Future Enhancements:
Adding support for tip calculations.
Integrating options for handling tax or discounts.
Implementing a user-friendly interface or web application for broader accessibility.
